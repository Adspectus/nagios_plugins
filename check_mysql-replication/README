1 - Requirement
---------------
To use it you first have to create an user with the REPLICATION CLIENT (or you can just grant this privilege)
mysql> GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT  TO 'replicateur'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

/!\ It seems you need to add the SELECT privilege on mysql.* for older than 5.1 mysql version
mysql> GRANT SELECT ON mysql.* TO 'replicateur'@'localhost';


2 - How to use it
