1 - About the plugin
--------------------
This plugin is inspired by the work of Travis Noll (http://yoolink.to/eG3)

This plugin is able to check a given JMX plan and to rise an alert if there is something wrong.
You're now able to use a scenario to check if your web server is ok.

To use it you'll need to have a jmeter plan, so:
