This script is inspired on 'cec-chk-coraid.sh' by William A. Arlofski 
(http://www.revpol.com/coraid_scripts).


1 - Purpose
-----------

- an alternative way to check your Coraid Device
- allow you to check : disks and raid state, if you still have spare disk
  and so on... 
- uses expect (http://expect.nist.gov/) and cec 
  (ftp://ftp.alyseo.com/pub/partners/Coraid/Tools/) programs instead of Java 


2 - Installation
----------------

First you have to install expect 
	$ sudo apt-get install expect (adapt this command line to your distrib)
and cec
	just download the source and run the make command


3 - Content
-----------

	check_coraid.pl : the main script. You will have to run only this 
			  script

	expect_scripts : this folder contains all the scripts which retrieve
			 informations from the Coraid device.
			 You never have to touch to this folder and its contain


4 - Howto use
-------------

First you have to edit the following variables of check_coraid.pl 
(Path variables) and adapt it to your configuration :
	statedir : path to save expect scripts outputs
	cec : path to cec program
	expect : path to expect program
	expect_script : path to expect_scripts folder

Add the following entry to your sudoers file to have the good privileges to run
the check_coraid.pl script :
	nagios ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /<path-to>/check_coraid.pl

Then just run this command line to display help :
	$ sudo /<path-to>/check_coraid.pl -h


5 - Examples of use
-------------------

- To show all disks UP with extra information for the shelf 0 on the bond0 
  interface
$ sudo /<path-to>/check_coraid.pl -s 0 -a show -i bond0 -m
CHECK CORAID - show - OK - (0.0,1000.205GB) (0.1,1000.205GB) (0.2,1000.205GB) (0.14,1000.205GB) are detected as UP - 4 disks UP

- To show all spare disks with extra information for the shelf 0 on the 
  bond0 interface
$ sudo /<path-to>/check_coraid.pl -s 0 -a spare -i bond0 -m
CHECK CORAID - spare - OK - (0.10,1000.205.GB) (0.11,1000.205GB) detected as SPARE - 2 disk(s) as SPARE


6 - Examples of NRPE integration
--------------------------------

NRPE server configuration (typically /etc/nagios/nrpe_local.cfg) :
command[check_coraid_spare]=/usr/bin/sudo /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_coraid.pl -s 1 -i bond0 -p -a spare
command[check_coraid_raid]=/usr/bin/sudo /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_coraid.pl -s 1 -i bond0 -p -a raid
command[check_coraid_show]=/usr/bin/sudo /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_coraid.pl -s 1 -i bond0 -p -a show
command[check_coraid_when]=/usr/bin/sudo /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_coraid.pl -s 1 -i bond0 -p -a when

Don't forget to restart the nrpe daemon : 
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nagios-nrpe-server restart


From your monitoring node, you only have to call the script just like this :
$ /<path-to>/check_nrpe -H $host_ip -c check_coraid_spare 

May be you have to specify a timeout value, in this case call the script like this :
$ /<path-to>/check_nrpe -H $host_ip -c check_coraid_spare -t 15


7- Info
-------

May be you have to adapt the except script to your config
- may be you have to change the cec prompt start (depends of your coraid firmware)
- in the same way the escape character could be different but according to the cec manpage with the -e option you can specify which character you will use to exit the cec command line interface... be aware !
